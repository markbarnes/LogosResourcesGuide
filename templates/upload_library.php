        <h1>Upload your library</h1>
        <p>To get the most out of this site, you can upload your library catalog. When you do so, you'll be able to see which resources you already own for any product, series, author or subject. It's like the official 'New to Me' service, but it works for every product.</p>
        <p style="border:2px solid #489E45;padding:5px;background-color:#eef7ed"><strong>Privacy policy:</strong> The file you are uploading does not include any personal data such as tags, collections or custom resource or series titles. Itâ€™s simply a list of all the resources in your library and all the resources you have hidden. All these resources (including hidden ones, but not personal books) will be added to the public site. However, other users won't know which resources belong to you, nor which resources you have hidden.</p>
        <p>Your library catalog file is stored in a hidden and randomised folder, so it takes a few steps to dig it out:</p>
